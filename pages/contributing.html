                        The League hosts all of its curriculum on github. Every level has its curriculum in its own “organization”. This is where you can go if you are interested in modifying or contributing to the curriculum. 
                        To modify or add a recipe simply <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request">fork</a> the module that you want to change and create a <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request">pull request</a>. This will allow our staff teachers to review the changes before they are entered into our curriculum.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can find the repositories for level 0 at <a href="http://www.github.com/League-level0">github.com/League-level0</a>. Please commit any new java recipes into the “extras” package located in each module. There they can be researched and developed using student feedback before they are officially added to the curriculum. Please email <a href="mailto:curriculum@jointheleague.org">curriculum@jointheleague.org</a> to be added to the organization as a contributor.
